# CLI Flags

Override a config option for one session without editing `~/.config/cliamp/config.toml`. Put flags before or after file and URL arguments.

## Playback

```sh
cliamp --vol -5 track.mp3             # startup volume in dB [volume_min, +6]
cliamp --shuffle ~/Music              # enable shuffle
cliamp --repeat all ~/Music           # repeat mode: off, all, one
cliamp --mono track.mp3               # downmix to mono
cliamp --no-mono track.mp3            # force stereo
cliamp --auto-play ~/Music            # start playback immediately
cliamp --playlist "Blade Runner"      # load a local TOML playlist (add --auto-play to start playback)
cliamp --provider podcast             # open on one provider for this session
```

`--provider` overrides `provider` in config.toml. It accepts the values in [Default Provider](configuration.md#default-provider), plus `abs` for `audiobookshelf`. Run `cliamp --help` to see the list.

## Audio engine

```sh
cliamp --sample-rate 48000 track.mp3      # output sample rate (0=auto, 22050, 44100, 48000, 96000, 192000)
cliamp --buffer-ms 2000 track.mp3         # speaker buffer in ms (50-5000; useful for unstable radio)
cliamp --resample-quality 1 track.mp3     # resample quality factor (1–4)
cliamp --bit-depth 32 track.m4a           # PCM bit depth: 16 (default) or 32 (lossless)
cliamp --audio-device list                # print the output devices, then exit
cliamp --audio-device NAME track.mp3      # use one output device for this session
```

`--audio-device` overrides `audio_device` in config.toml. See [Audio output device](configuration.md#audio-output-device) for the platform rules.

## Appearance

```sh
cliamp --simplified ~/Music                  # no visualizer or playlist
cliamp --expanded ~/Music                    # start with the playlist expanded (Ctrl+X state)
cliamp --eq-preset "Bass Boost" ~/Music
cliamp --visualizer Wave ~/Music             # start with one visualizer mode
cliamp --visualizer-60fps ~/Music            # smoother visualizer animation (higher CPU use)
```

`--visualizer-60fps` renders a visible visualizer at about 60 FPS during playback. `Wave`, `Scope`, `Heartbeat`, and `Stereo` already use this rate because they draw from audio samples. The flag does not affect overlays or low-power mode.

## Diagnostics

```sh
cliamp --log-level debug                     # raise log verbosity for one session
```

cliamp writes logs to `~/.config/cliamp/cliamp.log`. Use `debug`, `info` (default), `warn`, or `error`.

## Low-power mode

```sh
cliamp --low-power track.mp3                 # reduce CPU load for this session
```

This reduces CPU load. It lowers the UI and render rate and sets the visualizer to `none`. Use it on battery power, slow terminals, or SSH sessions. Press `v` in the player to enable a visualizer again.

To make this persistent, set it in `~/.config/cliamp/config.toml`:

```toml
low_power = true
```

## Headless daemon mode

```sh
cliamp --daemon                              # no TUI, IPC only
cliamp --daemon --auto-play --playlist Lofi  # start playing on launch
cliamp -d ~/Music --auto-play                # short flag form
```

Run cliamp without a UI. It runs the same player as the TUI and listens on the Unix socket that the TUI uses. All `cliamp <subcommand>` IPC clients work. Plugins, scrobbling, and Recently Played work as in the TUI. `cliamp theme <name>` and `cliamp vis <name|next>` return an error. The `list` forms still work. See [Headless Daemon Mode](headless.md) for use cases and configuration examples for Waybar, Hyprland, systemd, and cron.

## Search

Search for and play a track from the command line. This requires [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp):

```sh
cliamp search "never gonna give you up"       # search YouTube
cliamp search-sc "lofi beats"                  # search SoundCloud
```

To play only one video of a YouTube URL with a `list=` parameter, add `--no-expand-playlist`. `--expand-playlist` loads the whole playlist, which is the default. See [YouTube Music](youtube-music.md).

```sh
cliamp --no-expand-playlist 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO&list=PLAYLIST'
```

Press `Ctrl+F` in the player for context-aware search. cliamp uses the active provider search when available. Otherwise, it searches YouTube.

## Updates

```sh
cliamp upgrade                # latest stable release
cliamp upgrade --prerelease   # newest release, betas and release candidates included
```

Select prerelease updates for each upgrade. `--prerelease` installs the release with the highest SemVer version, stable or prerelease. It never installs a version older than the one you run. Normal installs, package-manager updates, and `cliamp upgrade` use stable releases only.

Maintainers publish a prerelease by tagging the release commit with a SemVer prerelease tag such as `v1.5.0-beta.1` or `v1.5.0-rc.1`. The release workflow builds binaries for all platforms and creates a GitHub prerelease. It does not update Homebrew, AUR, or the public changelog.

## General

| Flag | Short | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help and exit |
| `--version` | `-v` | Print version and exit |

## Shell completion

Generate completion scripts for supported shells.

```sh
cliamp completion bash
cliamp completion zsh
cliamp completion fish
cliamp completion pwsh
```

Source the generated script directly or install it as your shell documentation describes.

## Mixing flags and files

Put flags before, after, or between positional arguments:

```sh
cliamp --shuffle track.mp3 --vol -5
cliamp track.mp3 --repeat all --mono ~/Music
```

## Flag reference

| Flag | Type | Default | Range / Values |
|------|------|---------|----------------|
| `--vol` | float | 0 | `volume_min` (default -50) to +6 dB |
| `--shuffle` / `--no-shuffle` | bool | false | |
| `--repeat` | string | off | off, all, one |
| `--mono` / `--no-mono` | bool | false | |
| `--auto-play` / `--no-auto-play` | bool | false | |
| `--simplified` / `--no-simplified` | bool | false | artist/title and time strip; no visualizer or playlist |
| `--help-bar` / `--no-help-bar` | bool | true | show or hide the key-binding hint bar; `?` still opens the full keymap |
| `--expanded` / `--no-expanded` | bool | false | start with the playlist expanded (the `Ctrl+X` state) |
| `--provider` | string | cliamp | provider to open at start: cliamp, radio, podcast, navidrome, lyrion, plex, jellyfin, emby, spotify, qobuz, tidal, soundcloud, mixcloud, netease, yandex, audiobookshelf (or abs), yt, youtube, ytmusic |
| `--visualizer` | string | Bars | visualizer mode, such as Bars, Wave or None. See [configuration.md](configuration.md#options) for all modes. |
| `--visualizer-60fps` | bool | false | render a visible visualizer at about 60 FPS |
| `--start-theme` | string | | theme name |
| `--eq-preset` | string | | preset name |
| `--sample-rate` | int | 0 | 0, 22050, 44100, 48000, 96000, 192000. 0 reads the rate of the default output device on macOS and uses 44100 on other platforms. |
| `--buffer-ms` | int | 250 | 50-5000 |
| `--resample-quality` | int | 4 | 1-4 |
| `--bit-depth` | int | 16 | 16, 32 |
| `--audio-device` | string | | a device name from `--audio-device list`. `list` prints the devices and exits. |
| `--playlist` | string | | local TOML playlist name |
| `--log-level` | string | info | debug, info, warn, error |
| `--expand-playlist` / `--no-expand-playlist` | bool | true | expand YouTube and YouTube Music `list=` URLs to the full playlist. `--no-expand-playlist` plays only the video. |
| `--low-power` / `--no-low-power` | bool | false | lower UI cadence; disable visualization |
| `--daemon` / `-d` | bool | false | run headless; IPC only, no TUI |

CLI flags override config file values for the current session only. Persisted boolean options accept matching `--no-*` flags, such as `--no-shuffle` and `--no-low-power`. cliamp does not save them.

## Setup wizard

Configure remote providers through a small TUI. Supported providers are Navidrome, Lyrion, Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, Spotify, Qobuz, Tidal, SoundCloud, Mixcloud, NetEase, Yandex Music, Audiobookshelf, and YouTube Music. Each provider page links to its required credentials. The wizard writes the provider keys into the `[provider]` section of `~/.config/cliamp/config.toml` and leaves the rest of the file unchanged. For YouTube Music, it edits an existing `[youtube]` or `[yt]` section. It checks the server connection during setup for Navidrome, Lyrion, Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, and Audiobookshelf, and the browser session for NetEase. OAuth providers (Spotify, Qobuz, Tidal) authenticate later in the player. Setup does not check SoundCloud, Mixcloud, or Yandex Music credentials.

```sh
cliamp setup
```

Use `↑/↓` to navigate. Use `Enter` to confirm or submit. Use `Esc` to go back. Use `q` in the menu to quit. Passwords and tokens are masked. Running setup again for a configured provider updates the keys that setup manages. It keeps the other keys and comments in the section, such as `browse_sort`. It drops the comment at the end of a key line that it rewrites. It removes a managed key that the new choice does not use, such as `token` after a switch to password login.

## Playlist Management

Manage local TOML playlists from the command line without opening the TUI.

```sh
cliamp playlist list                          # list playlists with track counts
cliamp playlist create "Name"                 # create an empty playlist
cliamp playlist create "Name" file1 dir/ ...  # create from files/folders (recursive, skips duplicate paths)
cliamp playlist create "Name" --ssh HOST dir/ # create from remote machine via SSH
cliamp playlist create "Name" --dir ~/Music   # reference a directory as a [[dir]] source (scanned at load)
cliamp playlist add "Name" file1 ...          # append tracks to existing playlist, skipping duplicates
cliamp playlist add "Name" --dir ~/Music      # add another directory source
cliamp playlist dirs "Name"                   # list directory sources
cliamp playlist rename "Old" "New"            # rename a playlist
cliamp playlist show "Name"                   # display tracks
cliamp playlist show "Name" --json            # machine-readable output
cliamp playlist remove "Name" --index 3       # remove track by index
cliamp playlist dedupe "Name"                 # remove duplicate paths, keeping the first
cliamp playlist sort "Name" --by album         # sort in place
cliamp playlist doctor [Name]                  # report missing local files
cliamp playlist doctor "Name" --fix            # prune missing local files
cliamp playlist export "Name" -o mix.m3u       # export as M3U
cliamp playlist export "Name" --format pls     # export as PLS to stdout
cliamp playlist import mix.m3u --name "Name"   # import local M3U/M3U8/PLS
cliamp playlist favorite "Name" --index 3      # toggle the favorite of a track
cliamp playlist favorites                       # list favorite tracks
cliamp playlist enrich "Name"                   # probe duration/album 
cliamp playlist enrich "Name" --source metadata   # probe duration/album (forces to use the file's metadata as source)
cliamp playlist delete "Name"                   # delete entire playlist
```

Sort keys: `track`, `title`, `artist`, `album`, `artist+album`, `path`.

`playlist doctor --fix` prunes only playlist files. It reports a missing favorite and keeps it. To remove a favorite, run `cliamp playlist favorite Favorites --index N`.

`--ssh` takes `host`, `user@host`, or `host:port`. `playlist enrich` connects to the port in each `ssh://` track path.

See [playlists.md](playlists.md) for the TOML format. See [ssh-streaming.md](ssh-streaming.md) for remote playback.

## Recently Played

```sh
cliamp history                                # show the 50 most recent plays
cliamp history --limit 200                    # show the 200 most recent
cliamp history --limit 0                      # show all (capped at 200 entries on disk)
cliamp history --json                         # machine-readable output
cliamp history clear                          # wipe ~/.config/cliamp/history.toml
```

cliamp adds a track to the history when the track starts. In the TUI, the Local
Playlists provider shows this data in the virtual "Recently Played" entry. See
[history.md](history.md).

## Provider credentials

```sh
cliamp spotify reset                          # clear stored Spotify credentials
cliamp qobuz reset                            # clear stored Qobuz credentials
cliamp tidal reset                            # clear stored Tidal credentials
cliamp ytmusic reset                          # clear stored YouTube Music credentials
```

Use `spotify reset` for stale authentication errors, such as `401 Unauthorized` or a repeated sign-in prompt. Then restart cliamp and select Spotify to sign in again. It does not fix `rate-limited on /v1/me` warnings: those are `429` responses to an accepted token, so the app is out of quota rather than unauthorized. See [spotify.md](spotify.md) for the setup guide.

`qobuz reset`, `tidal reset` and `ytmusic reset` work the same way for their providers. See [qobuz.md](qobuz.md), [tidal.md](tidal.md) and [youtube-music.md](youtube-music.md).

## cliamp:// Links

Open a song from a browser, a script, or anything that can open a URL:

```sh
cliamp open 'cliamp://play?url=https://example.com/s.mp3'    # play a stream
cliamp open 'cliamp://play?provider=navidrome&album=a1b2c3'  # play an album
cliamp open 'cliamp://queue?provider=ytmusic&q=aphex+twin'   # queue a search hit
cliamp protocol status                                       # where it is registered
cliamp protocol register                                     # register the scheme
cliamp protocol unregister                                   # remove it
```

install.sh registers the scheme. See [url-scheme.md](url-scheme.md) for the
URI format and what links cannot do.

## Remote Control (IPC)

Control a running cliamp instance from another terminal:

```sh
cliamp play / pause / toggle / stop    # playback control
cliamp next / prev                     # track navigation
cliamp status                          # current state
cliamp status --json                   # machine-readable state
cliamp volume -5                       # set the volume to -5 dB
cliamp remote call volume.adjust --params '{"value":3}'    # raise the volume by 3 dB
cliamp seek 30                         # seek relative to current position (seconds)
cliamp remote call seek.absolute --params '{"value":90}'   # seek to 90s exactly
cliamp load "Playlist Name"            # load a playlist
cliamp queue /path/to/file.mp3         # queue a track
cliamp shuffle [on|off|toggle]         # toggle or set shuffle
cliamp repeat [off|all|one|cycle]      # set or cycle repeat mode
cliamp mono [on|off|toggle]            # toggle or set mono output
cliamp speed 1.5                       # set playback speed (0.25–2.0)
cliamp eq Rock                         # set EQ preset by name
cliamp eq --band 0 6.0                 # set EQ band 0 to +6 dB
cliamp device list                     # list audio output devices
cliamp device "My DAC"                 # switch audio output device
cliamp theme list                      # list the themes, terminal colors first
cliamp remote state                     # v2 GUI-ready runtime snapshot
cliamp remote capabilities              # v2 operation list
cliamp remote events runtime.state      # v2 event stream
```

`cliamp volume` sets an absolute level. A sign does not make the value relative, so `cliamp volume +3` sets the volume to +3 dB. To step the volume up or down, submit `volume.adjust` with `cliamp remote call`. A negative value lowers the volume. Both forms clamp the result to the range `volume_min` to +6 dB.

Each command waits up to 30 seconds for its result. `cliamp load` waits up to 5 minutes and `cliamp plugins call` up to 6 minutes. After that time the command fails with an error, and cliamp continues the operation. `cliamp remote call --wait` waits until the job ends.

`cliamp shuffle`, `cliamp repeat` and `cliamp mono` accept only the values in brackets, in any letter case. Another value gives an error and changes nothing.

`cliamp queue` accepts a relative path. It sends the absolute path of a local file, because the running cliamp has its own working directory. A URL or another URI, such as `spotify:track:...`, goes unchanged. A missing file or a directory gives an error.

`cliamp theme list` reads the theme files itself, so it works when cliamp is not running. It prints each theme file that it skips on stderr.

See [remote-control.md](remote-control.md) for the protocol specification.
