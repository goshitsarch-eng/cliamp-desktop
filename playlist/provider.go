// DurationSecs is optional: providers that can compute it cheaply should
// populate it so the UI can render a total runtime. A zero value means
// "unknown" and the UI will hide the duration column.
//
// Section is optional: providers may set it to group their playlists in the UI.
// Adjacent rows that share a Section are rendered under one header; a change of
// Section emits a "── header ──" divider. The radio provider uses
// SectionedList.IDPrefix instead and leaves Section empty.
//
// DirSourceCount is optional: providers that back playlists with [[dir]]
// directory sources set it so the UI can flag them in the list. A zero value
// means "none/unknown" and the UI hides the indicator.
//
// Favorite is optional: a provider sets it on a row of its favorites
// section, such as a favorite radio station or a subscribed podcast show.
// Other rows of the same station or show do not set it. The IPC playlist
// list reports it.
